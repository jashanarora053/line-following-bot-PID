# line-following-bot-PID
**In first part** {where we define variable,constants,..} i defined 


1.Pins{sensor pins and motor driver pins}


2.Defined tuning parameters and variables req for PID Controller


3.Defined base speed for motors with which they will rotate in normal codition. 










**In Setup part** {Simply did three things}




1.set sensor pins as input pins


2.set motor driver pins as output pins



3.setup serial monitor to pop up a starting msg so as to confirm it has started.  


**IN Void loop part**
in this part took reading from all five sensors and acc to
ten possible cases returned an error value
